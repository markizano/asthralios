# Research Topics

Here, I document what I have found as far as my research goes.

## LLM Gateway

### Open WebUI

- [Official Website](https://openwebui.com/) for the project.
- [Official Github](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) for the project.

**Libraries**:

- [Python Library](https://bemade.github.io/openwebui-client/)
- [PyPi Package](https://pypi.org/project/openwebui-client/)

## Chat Bots

For the chat bots possible, I document what I find here.

### Discord API

You can head on over to [Discord for Developers](https://discord.com/developers/) and sign up to create an account
or use your existing account to [create an app](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

**Libraries**:

- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin)

### Slack API

You can visit [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps) to configure and setup an app.

- [NodeJS documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/node-slack-sdk/)
- - [SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-python/) using "Bolt".

### Microsoft Teams

You have to first sign up for a [MS365 Dev Account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/profile).
Once you've signed up for the program, you can then proceed to find the instructions to install the app.

[Installing an MS Teams App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/sbs-gs-nodejs) is a challenge.
It involves lots of software and a business account that you just can't achieve with the free account.

This **will absolutely require** interfacing with the MS Teams Admins of a business account.
